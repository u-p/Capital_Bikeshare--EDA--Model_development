Jupyter notebook for carrying out the following steps on the Bike Sharing data available from capitalbikeshare
 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: explore correlations among variables, various influencing factors for the bike count

 1. **Feature Engineering**: get rid of redundant features and transform the features

 1. **Regression Model**: predict the number of bikes rented each hour based on various features -- season, month, type of the day (weekday / weekend / holiday), hour of the day, weather (temperature, humidity, windspeeds, rain, snow etc.) -- and using the _Poisson_ Regression
